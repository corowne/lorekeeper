    | Character Codes
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | character_codes:
    |       This is used in the automatic generation of character codes.
    |       {category}: This is replaced by the character category code.
    |       {number}: This is replaced by the character number.
    |
    |       e.g. Under the default setting ({category}-{number}),
    |       a character in a category called "MYO" (code "MYO") with number 001
    |       will have the character code of MYO-001.
    |
    |       !IMPORTANT!
    |       As this is used to generate the character's URL, sticking to
    |       alphanumeric, hyphen (-) and underscore (_) characters
    |       is advised.
    |
    | character_number_digits:
    |       This specifies the default number of digits for {number} when
    |       pulled automatically.
    |
    |       e.g. If the next number is 2, setting this to 3 would give 002.
    |
    | character_pull_number:
    |       This determines if the next {number} is pulled from the highest
    |       existing number, or the highest number in the category.
    |       This value can be "all" (default) or "category".
    |
    |       e.g. if the following characters exist:
    |       Standard (STD) category: STD-001, STD-002, STD-003
    |       MYO (MYO) category:      MYO-001, MYO-002
    |       If character_pull_number is 'all':
    |           The next number pulled will be 004 regardless of category.
    |       If character_pull_number is 'category':
    |           The next number pulled for STD will be 004.
    |           The next number pulled for MYO will be 003.
    |
    | reset_character_status_on_transfer:
    |       This determines whether owner-set character status--
    |       trading, gift art, and gift writing--
    |       should be cleared when the character is transferred to a new owner.
    |       Default: 0/Disabled, 1 to enable.
    |
    | reset_character_profile_on_transfer:
    |       This determines whether character name and profile should be cleared
    |       when the character is transferred to a new owner.
    |       Default: 0/Disabled, 1 to enable.
    |
    | clear_myo_slot_name_on_approval:
    |       Whether the "name" given to a MYO slot should be cleared when a design update for it is approved/
    |       the slot becomes a full character.
    |       Default: 0/Disabled, 1 to enable.
